  "Then we substantiate our claim of a need for a new chaplain-led intervention, building on various promising and effective interventions of spiritual care that have been developed in recent years.",
  "The framework allows us to: i better qualify the categories of sustaining and disruptive innovation; ii understand the evolution of hybrid patterns of market innovation, since the elements of emerging disruptive innovations sometimes sustain the established technology, and; iii assess and map emerging market patterns.",
  "More importantly, we develop a novel hypothesis about the complementarity between founder social capital and a startup's technological capabilities to suggest that the bargaining impact of founders' social capital becomes more pronounced when a startup is also endowed with superior technological capabilities.",
  "In this setting we will develop novel analysis tools for generic identifiability of subnetworks that are formulated in terms of disconnecting sets in the graph of the network models, and we will show that this leads to a new and effective synthesis procedure for allocating external excitation signals for achieving identifiability of a subnetwork.",

  "Here, we critically review the most important pre-clinical and clinical findings, recent advances in CAR-T against myeloma, as well as discoveries in the biology of a still incurable disease, that, all together, will further improve safety and efficacy in relapsedrefractory patients, urgently in need of novel treatment options.",
